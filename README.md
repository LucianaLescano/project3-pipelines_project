# Pipelines Project

This week's project is about improving my data finding skills.

## How? üßê
I used two datasets:
1) Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016 using Kaggle.
2) NCHS - Leading Causes of Death: United States via API.
If you are interested in finding this information, I leave the links at the end.

## What did I did? ü§î
In this case, with the help of pandas, seaborn, some functions and a lot of patience: 
- I cleaned the dataset.
- I worked on my functions and making them smaller.
- Make different graphs.
- I set up a hypothesis and tried to prove it.

## All about my hypothesis ü§ì
Is there a relation between suicide rates and the different parties in government?

Maybe this sounds a little bit creepy,  but let's see if this have some sense. 

I am certainly not the first to think about it, as I have found different studies to talk about it.

If you wanna see my presentation and take a look at the studies, I leave the links below.
